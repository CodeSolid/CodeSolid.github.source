excerpt: Another test post.  Are you kidding me?  I wouldn't read this drivel if I were you.  I know it's going to say "Read more..." in a minute, but I would just flat out ignore that.  Seriously.

This is simply a test post.  I've been going back and forth on how the Rakefile and Github branches / repositories should be set up for the CodeSolid web site. 

I think I have it licked, but this should have been much easier.

Let's try an edit and check out how fast and easy.

So the solution (for those of you who prefer to read solutions rather than test posts, which should be all of you):

* Use two repositories, not one.  No, seriously.
* That being done, [here's the Rakefile](https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid.github.source/blob/master/Rakefile) I'm using.
